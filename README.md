# How computer work
A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device

The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, takes over and processes the information it was given. Once the data is ready, it will be sent back through an output device which can be a monitor, speaker, printer, ports, etc.

 # Here are the main components of a computer:
 * CPU – or Central Processing Unit is considered the most important component in a computer and for good reason
 * RAM – Random Access Memory, or RAM for short, is a computer component where data used by the operating system and software applications    store data so that the CPU can process them quickly.
 * HDD – Also known as Hard Disk Drive, it is the component where photos, apps, documents and such are kept.
 * Motherboard – There is no acronym for this component but without it, there can’t be a computer.
 * Video and Sound Cards – Two components which help the user interact with the computer.
 * Network adapter – Even though it is not actually required to operate the computer, the Network adapter improves the user’s experience as    it provides access to the internet.
